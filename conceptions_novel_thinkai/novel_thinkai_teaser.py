# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
#   I'm documenting a seed concept for an ARC-like (Abstraction & Reasoning)
#   approach while I'm still learning. This is a *public teaser* to show my
#   thinking process, Git fluency, and commitment to ethical AI practice.
#   This is not the full method. Key parts are intentionally redacted.
#
# TL;DR CONCEPT (SAFE TO SHARE)
#   1) Let an agent *discover* a salient internal quantity Q_self(t) directly
#      from observations (not hard-coded).
#   2) Let it *infer* a counterpart Q_env(t) that reflects external pressure
#      or opportunity (a proxy for "stimuli"/constraints).
#   3) Compare short-horizon trends or deltas and react:
#          Δ = [Q_self(t) - Q_env(t)] over a small time window
#      • If Δ << 0 → "EVOLVE_OR_DIE": prioritize exploring a new hypothesis,
#        representation, or tool-use pathway.
#      • If Δ ≥ 0 → "OBSERVE & FARM": consolidate, harvest easy wins, or
#        re-optimize resources until the environment shifts again.
#
#      This is *not* about a single scalar; it's about learning to identify
#      a compact *signal* that generalizes across tasks and changes over time.
#      (Think: meta-feature emergence + adaptive control of exploration.)
#
# WHAT’S DELIBERATELY HIDDEN
#   • The pipeline that surfaces Q_self and Q_env (feature search & gating)
#   • The internal hypothesis marketplace & evaluation budget policy
#   • The representation “ladder” and transfer triggers
#   • The novelty guardrails & collapse-prevention heuristics
#
# REDACTED SKETCH (intentionally vague pseudocode)

#   # └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
#   # Δ = trend(Q_self) - trend(Q_env)   # robust trend estimator
#   # if Δ < τ_neg:  action = EVOLVE_OR_DIE   # explore new skill/program
#   # elif Δ > τ_pos: action = FARM_AND_OPTIMIZE
#   # else:           action = SAFE_OBSERVE   # low-cost probes
#
# TO RECRUITERS / REVIEWERS
#   • I’m learning by shipping tiny, well-documented steps.
#   • I use branches & PRs even for solo work to practice review hygiene.
#   • I care about interpretable levers and safety switches.
#
# BRANCHING PLAN (for Git hygiene)
#   - main           : teaser + lightweight runnable demo (this file)
#   - feat/signals   : stubs for signal discovery interface (no secrets)
#   - feat/policies  : pluggable policy enums & toy schedulers
#   - docs/roadmap   : milestones & evaluation notes (public-safe)
#
# ROADMAP (PUBLIC-SAFE)
#   [v0]  This teaser & toy comparator (done)
#   [v1]  Deterministic toy demo with synthetic signals
#   [v2]  Plug-in interface for “signal providers” (no private IP)
#   [v3]  Mini evaluation harness on hand-crafted puzzles
#
# ETHICS & INTENT
#   This idea is shared to attract collaboration/employment *and* to remind
#   myself that capability should serve communities and the planet.
