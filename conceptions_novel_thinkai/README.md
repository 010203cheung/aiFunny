# 🧠 Novel ThinkAI — Conceptions (v0)
*An exploratory concept for AI that learns when to evolve and when to observe.*

---

## 💡 Overview
This project is a **thought experiment and code teaser** inspired by the [ARC Prize 2025](https://arcprize.org/) challenge —  
to create an AI capable of *novel reasoning* and *efficient self-adaptation*.

> “If the environment outpaces you, evolve or die.  
>  If you’re ahead, observe and optimize.”

Here, the AI doesn’t rely on huge datasets — it instead *compares its own internal signal* (`Q_self`) with an *external environment signal* (`Q_env`) and reacts accordingly.

---

## 🧩 Core Concept (Simplified)
- The AI autonomously discovers an internal **quantity** that represents its progress or stability.  
- It observes a corresponding **external quantity** that reflects challenge or opportunity.  
- By comparing trends of both over time:
  - **Negative delta** → *Evolve or Die* (seek novelty / new strategy)  
  - **Positive delta** → *Observe & Farm* (refine or consolidate)

This minimal rule forms a self-adaptive reasoning cycle — a micro version of evolution logic.

## 🧭 Roadmap
- **v0** — Public teaser (this release).  
- **v1** — Add minimal signal discovery stub.  
- **v2** — Integrate evaluation harness for toy reasoning tasks.  
- **v3** — Explore self-evolving exploration thresholds.

## 🧱 Git Practice Note
This folder is part of a larger sandbox repository: **aiFunny**  
Each “quest” under aiFunny showcases learning-in-public experiments, blending AI, reasoning, and a sense of humor in the process.
