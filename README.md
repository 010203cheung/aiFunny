**Learning-in-Public Experiments by [010203cheung](https://github.com/010203cheung)**  
*A sandbox of AI quests, code experiments, and conceptual mini-projects.*

## 🌱 About This Repository
`aiFunny` is my open learning lab — a space where I explore Python, AI reasoning, and creative problem-solving through small but meaningful projects.

Each file or folder represents a **quest**:  
- Some are textbook-based warmups (`v0` series).  
- Others are inspired spinoffs or conceptual prototypes (`v0.1` and beyond).  
- A few evolve into fully themed sub-projects, complete with documentation and code teasers.

> “Learning by shipping small, thinking big, and keeping it a little funny.”

## 🧩 Current Quests

| Quest / Folder | Description | Stage |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| `v0_basics/` | Early Python warm-ups and textbook question solutions. | 🌱 Basic |
| `conceptions_novel_thinkai/` | Inspired by [Kaggle ARC Prize 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/arc-prize-2025); explores AI reasoning via internal vs external signal dynamics. | 🧠 Concept |
| *(more coming soon)* | Additional “aiFunny” experiments, mini-scripts, and reasoning tools. | 🚧 In Progress |

## 🧠 Philosophy
1. **Iterate visibly.** Share messy drafts and micro-progress instead of waiting for perfection.  
2. **Think like a scientist.** Each quest is an experiment — even failed ones teach structure and clarity.  
3. **Stay ethical.** Capability should serve communities and the planet.  
4. **Have fun.** Humor and curiosity keep learning sustainable.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Practices
- **Language:** Python 3.10+  
- **Workflow:** Git branching & version control practice  
- **Style:** PEP8, clear docstrings, heavy commenting for transparency  
- **Platform:** GitHub (learning in public)  

---

## 🚀 Future Directions
- Add AI-art & music-generating experiments (linking back to creative roots).  
- Develop a lightweight framework for “self-adaptive mini-agents.”  
- Continue building portfolio-level teasers that show conceptual reasoning skills.
